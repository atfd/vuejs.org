## What are Components?

Components are one of the most powerful features of Vue. They help you extend basic HTML elements to encapsulate reusable code. At a high level, components are custom elements that Vue's compiler attaches behavior to. In some cases, they may also appear as a native HTML element extended with the special `is` attribute.

All Vue components are also Vue instances, and so accept the same options object (except for a few root-specific options) and provide the same lifecycle hooks.

## Using Components

### Global Registration

We've learned in the previous sections that we can create a new Vue instance with:

``` js
new Vue({
  el: '#some-element',
  // options
})
```

To register a global component, you can use `Vue.component(tagName, options)`. For example:

``` js
Vue.component('my-component', {
  // options
})
```

<p class="tip">Note that Vue does not enforce the [W3C rules](https://www.w3.org/TR/custom-elements/#concepts) for custom tag names (all-lowercase, must contain a hyphen) though following this convention is considered good practice.</p>

Once registered, a component can be used in an instance's template as a custom element, `<my-component></my-component>`. Make sure the component is registered **before** you instantiate the root Vue instance. Here's the full example:

``` html
<div id="example">
  <my-component></my-component>
</div>
```

``` js
// register
Vue.component('my-component', {
  template: '<div>A custom component!</div>'
})

// create a root instance
new Vue({
  el: '#example'
})
```

Which will render:

``` html
<div id="example">
  <div>A custom component!</div>
</div>
```

{% raw %}
<div id="example" class="demo">
  <my-component></my-component>
</div>
<script>
Vue.component('my-component', {
  template: '<div>A custom component!</div>'
})
new Vue({ el: '#example' })
</script>
{% endraw %}

### Local Registration

You don't have to register every component globally. You can make a component available only in the scope of another instance/component by registering it with the `components` instance option:

``` js
var Child = {
  template: '<div>A custom component!</div>'
}

new Vue({
  // ...
  components: {
    // <my-component> will only be available in parent's template
    'my-component': Child
  }
})
```

The same encapsulation applies for other registerable Vue features, such as directives.

### DOM Template Parsing Caveats

When using the DOM as your template (e.g. using the `el` option to mount an element with existing content), you will be subject to some restrictions that are inherent to how HTML works, because Vue can only retrieve the template content **after** the browser has parsed and normalized it. Most notably, some elements such as `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<table>` and `<select>` have restrictions on what elements can appear inside them, and some elements such as `<option>` can only appear inside certain other elements.

This will lead to issues when using custom components with elements that have such restrictions, for example:

``` html
<table>
  <my-row>...</my-row>
</table>
```

The custom component `<my-row>` will be hoisted out as invalid content, thus causing errors in the eventual rendered output. A workaround is to use the `is` special attribute:

``` html
<table>
  <tr is="my-row"></tr>
</table>
```

**It should be noted that these limitations do not apply if you are using string templates from one of the following sources**:

- `<script type="text/x-template">`
- JavaScript inline template strings
- `.vue` components

Therefore, prefer using string templates whenever possible.

### `data` Must Be a Function

Most of the options that can be passed into the Vue constructor can be used in a component, with one special case: `data` must be a function. In fact, if you try this:

``` js
Vue.component('my-component', {
  template: '<span>{{ message }}</span>',
  data: {
    message: 'hello'
  }
})
```

Then Vue will halt and emit warnings in the console, telling you that `data` must be a function for component instances. It's good to understand why the rules exist though, so let's cheat.

``` html
<div id="example-2">
  <simple-counter></simple-counter>
  <simple-counter></simple-counter>
  <simple-counter></simple-counter>
</div>
```

``` js
var data = { counter: 0 }

Vue.component('simple-counter', {
  template: '<button v-on:click="counter += 1">{{ counter }}</button>',
  // data is technically a function, so Vue won't
  // complain, but we return the same object
  // reference for each component instance
  data: function () {
    return data
  }
})

new Vue({
  el: '#example-2'
})
```

{% raw %}
<div id="example-2" class="demo">
  <simple-counter></simple-counter>
  <simple-counter></simple-counter>
  <simple-counter></simple-counter>
</div>
<script>
var data = { counter: 0 }
Vue.component('simple-counter', {
  template: '<button v-on:click="counter += 1">{{ counter }}</button>',
  data: function () {
    return data
  }
})
new Vue({
  el: '#example-2'
})
</script>
{% endraw %}

Since all three component instances share the same `data` object, incrementing one counter increments them all! Ouch. Let's fix this by instead returning a fresh data object:

``` js
data: function () {
  return {
    counter: 0
  }
}
```

Now all our counters each have their own internal state:

{% raw %}
<div id="example-2-5" class="demo">
  <my-component></my-component>
  <my-component></my-component>
  <my-component></my-component>
</div>
<script>
Vue.component('my-component', {
  template: '<button v-on:click="counter += 1">{{ counter }}</button>',
  data: function () {
    return {
      counter: 0
    }
  }
})
new Vue({
  el: '#example-2-5'
})
</script>
{% endraw %}

### Composing Components

Components are meant to be used together, most commonly in parent-child relationships: component A may use component B in its own template. They inevitably need to communicate to one another: the parent may need to pass data down to the child, and the child may need to inform the parent of something that happened in the child. However, it is also very important to keep the parent and the child as decoupled as possible via a clearly-defined interface. This ensures each component's code can be written and reasoned about in relative isolation, thus making them more maintainable and potentially easier to reuse.

In Vue, the parent-child component relationship can be summarized as **props down, events up**. The parent passes data down to the child via **props**, and the child sends messages to the parent via **events**. Let's see how they work next.
