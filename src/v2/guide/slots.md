## Content Distribution with Slots

When using components, it is often desired to compose them like this:

``` html
<app>
  <app-header></app-header>
  <app-footer></app-footer>
</app>
```

There are two things to note here:

1. The `<app>` component does not know what content it will receive. It is decided by the component using `<app>`.

2. The `<app>` component very likely has its own template.

To make the composition work, we need a way to interweave the parent "content" and the component's own template. This is a process called **content distribution** (or "transclusion" if you are familiar with Angular). Vue.js implements a content distribution API that is modeled after the current [Web Components spec draft](https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/blob/gh-pages/proposals/Slots-Proposal.md), using the special `<slot>` element to serve as distribution outlets for the original content.

### Compilation Scope

Before we dig into the API, let's first clarify which scope the contents are compiled in. Imagine a template like this:

``` html
<child-component>
  {{ message }}
</child-component>
```

Should the `message` be bound to the parent's data or the child data? The answer is the parent. A simple rule of thumb for component scope is:

> Everything in the parent template is compiled in parent scope; everything in the child template is compiled in child scope.

A common mistake is trying to bind a directive to a child property/method in the parent template:

``` html
<!-- does NOT work -->
<child-component v-show="someChildProperty"></child-component>
```

Assuming `someChildProperty` is a property on the child component, the example above would not work. The parent's template is not aware of the state of a child component.

If you need to bind child-scope directives on a component root node, you should do so in the child component's own template:

``` js
Vue.component('child-component', {
  // this does work, because we are in the right scope
  template: '<div v-show="someChildProperty">Child</div>',
  data: function () {
    return {
      someChildProperty: true
    }
  }
})
```

Similarly, distributed content will be compiled in the parent scope.

### Single Slot

Parent content will be **discarded** unless the child component template contains at least one `<slot>` outlet. When there is only one slot with no attributes, the entire content fragment will be inserted at its position in the DOM, replacing the slot itself.

Anything originally inside the `<slot>` tags is considered **fallback content**. Fallback content is compiled in the child scope and will only be displayed if the hosting element is empty and has no content to be inserted.

Suppose we have a component called `my-component` with the following template:

``` html
<div>
  <h2>I'm the child title</h2>
  <slot>
    This will only be displayed if there is no content
    to be distributed.
  </slot>
</div>
```

And a parent that uses the component:

``` html
<div>
  <h1>I'm the parent title</h1>
  <my-component>
    <p>This is some original content</p>
    <p>This is some more original content</p>
  </my-component>
</div>
```

The rendered result will be:

``` html
<div>
  <h1>I'm the parent title</h1>
  <div>
    <h2>I'm the child title</h2>
    <p>This is some original content</p>
    <p>This is some more original content</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Named Slots

`<slot>` elements have a special attribute, `name`, which can be used to further customize how content should be distributed. You can have multiple slots with different names. A named slot will match any element that has a corresponding `slot` attribute in the content fragment.

There can still be one unnamed slot, which is the **default slot** that serves as a catch-all outlet for any unmatched content. If there is no default slot, unmatched content will be discarded.

For example, suppose we have an `app-layout` component with the following template:

``` html
<div class="container">
  <header>
    <slot name="header"></slot>
  </header>
  <main>
    <slot></slot>
  </main>
  <footer>
    <slot name="footer"></slot>
  </footer>
</div>
```

Parent markup:

``` html
<app-layout>
  <h1 slot="header">Here might be a page title</h1>

  <p>A paragraph for the main content.</p>
  <p>And another one.</p>

  <p slot="footer">Here's some contact info</p>
</app-layout>
```

The rendered result will be:

``` html
<div class="container">
  <header>
    <h1>Here might be a page title</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p>A paragraph for the main content.</p>
    <p>And another one.</p>
  </main>
  <footer>
    <p>Here's some contact info</p>
  </footer>
</div>
```

The content distribution API is a very useful mechanism when designing components that are meant to be composed together.

### Scoped Slots

> New in 2.1.0+

A scoped slot is a special type of slot that functions as a reusable template (that can be passed data to) instead of already-rendered-elements.

In a child component, pass data into a slot as if you are passing props to a component:

``` html
<div class="child">
  <slot text="hello from child"></slot>
</div>
```

In the parent, a `<template>` element with a special attribute `slot-scope` must exist, indicating that it is a template for a scoped slot. The value of `slot-scope` will be used as the name of a temporary variable that holds the props object passed from the child:

``` html
<div class="parent">
  <child>
    <template slot-scope="props">
      <span>hello from parent</span>
      <span>{{ props.text }}</span>
    </template>
  </child>
</div>
```

If we render the above, the output will be:

``` html
<div class="parent">
  <div class="child">
    <span>hello from parent</span>
    <span>hello from child</span>
  </div>
</div>
```

> In 2.5.0+, `slot-scope` is no longer limited to `<template>` and can be used on any element or component.

A more typical use case for scoped slots would be a list component that allows the component consumer to customize how each item in the list should be rendered:

``` html
<my-awesome-list :items="items">
  <!-- scoped slot can be named too -->
  <li
    slot="item"
    slot-scope="props"
    class="my-fancy-item">
    {{ props.text }}
  </li>
</my-awesome-list>
```

And the template for the list component:

``` html
<ul>
  <slot name="item"
    v-for="item in items"
    :text="item.text">
    <!-- fallback content here -->
  </slot>
</ul>
```

#### Destructuring

`slot-scope`'s value is in fact a valid JavaScript expression that can appear in the argument position of a function signature. This means in supported environments (in single-file components or in modern browsers) you can also use ES2015 destructuring in the expression:

``` html
<child>
  <span slot-scope="{ text }">{{ text }}</span>
</child>
```
